# Spill-The-Beans
StormHacks 2021 Project by Team: Rise and Grind

We aimed to help close the disconnect between fair trade producers and consumers by providing a platform for the producers to tell their stories, and a place for the community to engage with their stories and foster deeper understanding alongside mutual respect. We understand there can be technological barriers preventing producers from gaining a platform to speak out against unfair practices, and aim to be a place to both support and amplify their voices.

We are a group of budding web developers who have taken 24 hours to create a project at Stormhacks 2021, and hope our website will help connect all people of the fair trade system. We are proud of the developed front-end website we have created in the time provided. Has no back-end functionality implemented.

Created using: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and Figma

Special thanks to the Stormhacks 2021 Team, SFU Surge, and SFU Fair Trade for their help, resources, and planning the hackathon we participated in.
